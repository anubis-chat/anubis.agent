## Troubleshooting

### Low Balance Warning
If you see "⚠️ Low SOL balance" in logs:
- Fund the wallet with at least 0.1 SOL
- Restart the agent after funding

### Transaction Failures
If transactions fail with "insufficient funds":
- Check current balance
- Ensure at least 0.005 SOL for transaction fees
- Consider network congestion (may need higher fees)
